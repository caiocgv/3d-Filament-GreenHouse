# Gerber Files

This directory is prepared for PCB manufacturing Gerber files.

## Expected Files

When the PCB design is complete, this directory will contain:

- FilamentDryer-F_Cu.gbr (Front copper layer)
- FilamentDryer-B_Cu.gbr (Back copper layer)
- FilamentDryer-F_Mask.gbr (Front solder mask)
- FilamentDryer-B_Mask.gbr (Back solder mask)
- FilamentDryer-F_SilkS.gbr (Front silkscreen)
- FilamentDryer-B_SilkS.gbr (Back silkscreen)
- FilamentDryer-Edge_Cuts.gbr (Board outline)
- FilamentDryer-drill.drl (Drill file)

## Usage

1. Download all files from this directory
2. Zip them together
3. Upload to your PCB manufacturer's website
4. Review the preview and specifications
5. Order your PCBs

## Manufacturer Recommendations

- **JLCPCB** - Best for budget-friendly orders (5 pcs from $2)
- **PCBWay** - Good quality with fast turnaround
- **OSH Park** - Premium quality, USA-based
- **Seeed Studio** - Good for prototypes and small runs

## Note

Gerber files will be added as the PCB design is finalized. In the meantime, you can build the project using a breadboard or prototype board following the wiring diagram in the main README.
