Total Estimated Cost:
Base Project (breadboard): $35-70 USD
Complete Project (with enclosure): $60-120 USD
With Custom PCB: $70-150 USD
With All Optional Features: $100-200 USD

Cost-Saving Tips:
1. Use existing USB power adapter (most have 5V 1-2A output)
2. Salvage enclosure from food storage containers
3. Buy components in bulk kits (resistors, LEDs, wires)
4. Use breadboard instead of custom PCB for prototyping
5. Skip 3D printed enclosure initially, use cardboard box
6. Purchase from AliExpress for lowest prices (longer shipping)
7. Check local electronics recycling for salvageable parts

Bulk Purchase Recommendations:
- Arduino/ESP8266 starter kits often include many needed components
- Sensor kits provide DHT22 and alternatives at lower cost
- Wire and resistor assortment kits are economical
- Consider group buys for PCB manufacturing to share costs

Where to Buy:
USA: Amazon, Adafruit, SparkFun, Digi-Key, Mouser, Micro Center
Europe: RS Components, Farnell, Conrad Electronic, Reichelt
Worldwide: AliExpress, Banggood (longer shipping, lower prices)
PCBs: JLCPCB, PCBWay, OSH Park, Seeed Studio, Eurocircuits

Notes:
- Prices are estimates and vary by region and supplier
- Shipping costs not included
- Bulk purchases reduce per-unit cost
- Quality varies - read reviews before purchasing
- Some suppliers offer student/educational discounts
- Consider local availability for faster project start

Safety Equipment:
- Safety glasses for soldering
- Fire extinguisher nearby when testing
- ESD strap for handling electronics (optional but recommended)
- Proper ventilation for soldering
- Insulated tools for any mains voltage work
