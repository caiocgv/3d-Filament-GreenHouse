## Overview

3D printer filaments are hygroscopic, meaning they absorb moisture from the air. This moisture can cause printing issues like:
- Poor layer adhesion
- Stringing and oozing
- Bubbling and popping during extrusion
- Reduced print quality and strength

This Filament Greenhouse Dryer solves these problems by maintaining a controlled, low-humidity environment with optional heating to actively dry filaments before and during storage.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: View current temperature
- **Adjustable Temperature Control**: Set target temperature (up to 70°C recommended for most filaments)
- **Timer Function**: Set drying duration (1 minute to 24 hours)
- **Web Portal Interface**: Control everything from your smartphone, tablet, or computer
- **WiFi Connectivity**: Connect to your home network for easy access
- **Automatic Shutoff**: System turns off automatically when timer expires
- **Manual Control**: Turn the heater on/off at any time
- **Temperature Safety**: Prevents overheating with built-in limits
- **Responsive Design**: Web interface works on all devices
- **LittleFS Filesystem**: HTML pages served from internal flash memory

## How It Works

### System Architecture

The Filament Greenhouse Dryer uses an ESP8266 microcontroller as its brain, coordinating several components:

1. **ESP8266 WiFi Module**: 
   - Hosts a web server accessible via your local network
   - Processes API requests from the web interface
   - Controls the heating element via relay
   - Reads sensor data and manages the timer

2. **LM35 Temperature Sensor**:
   - Measures ambient temperature (accurate to ±0.5°C at 25°C)
   - Analog output: 10mV per degree Celsius
   - Temperature range: 0°C to 100°C
   - Provides readings via ESP8266's ADC (A0 pin)

3. **Relay Module**:
   - Switches the heating element on/off based on temperature readings
   - Electrically isolates the low-voltage control circuit from high-voltage heater
   - LED indicator shows heater status

4. **Heating Element**:
   - Low-wattage heater (typically 40-60W) safely raises temperature
   - Distributes heat evenly throughout the enclosure
   - Works in conjunction with the relay for temperature control

### Control Logic

The system implements a simple but effective control algorithm:

**Temperature Control (PID-like behavior)**:
```
IF current_temp < (target_temp - 2°C):
    Turn heater ON
ELSE IF current_temp > target_temp:
    Turn heater OFF
ELSE:
    Maintain current state (hysteresis)
```

**Timer Management**:
- User sets desired drying duration
- Timer counts down while system is active
- System automatically shuts off when timer reaches zero
- Timer can be adjusted or canceled at any time

**Safety Features**:
- Maximum temperature limit (75°C hard coded)
- Automatic shutoff if sensor fails
- WiFi connection timeout handling
- Watchdog timer to prevent system hangs

### Web Interface Communication

The web portal uses AJAX to communicate with the ESP8266:

1. Browser loads HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface
2. JavaScript polls the ESP8266 every 2 seconds for status updates
3. User interactions (button clicks, slider changes) send API requests
4. ESP8266 responds with JSON data containing current state
5. Interface updates in real-time without page reload

| PETG | 50°C | 6-8 hours |
| ABS | 60°C | 4-6 hours |
| Nylon | 70°C | 12-16 hours |
| TPU/TPE | 50°C | 4-6 hours |

### Tips for Best Results

- Start with clean, dry filament for baseline
- Don't exceed recommended temperatures for each filament type
- Use desiccant packets in enclosure for passive moisture control
- Keep enclosure sealed during drying process
- Allow filament to cool before removing (prevents immediate re-absorption)

## Troubleshooting

### ESP8266 Won't Connect to WiFi

- **Check credentials**: Verify SSID and password are correct
- **Signal strength**: Move closer to router or use WiFi extender
- **2.4GHz network**: ESP8266 doesn't support 5GHz WiFi
- **Reset**: Try resetting ESP8266 and router
- **Serial monitor**: Check for error messages at 115200 baud

### Web Page Won't Load

- **IP address**: Verify correct IP from serial monitor
- **Same network**: Ensure device is on same WiFi network as ESP8266
- **Firewall**: Check if firewall is blocking port 80
- **Restart ESP8266**: Power cycle the device
- **Filesystem not uploaded**: Check Serial Monitor for "Failed to mount LittleFS" - need to upload filesystem using LittleFS Data Upload tool

### Temperature Not Changing

- **Sensor connection**: Check LM35 wiring (VCC, GND, Output to A0)
- **Sensor orientation**: Flat side should face away from pins, pins down: VCC(left), Output(middle), GND(right)
- **Sensor failure**: Try reading sensor values in serial monitor
- **Heater power**: Verify heater is receiving power through relay
- **Relay clicking**: Listen for relay activation sound
- **Target temperature**: Ensure target is higher than ambient

### Heater Stays On Constantly

- **Target too high**: Lower the target temperature
- **Sensor placement**: Ensure sensor measures correct location
- **Code issue**: Check temperature control logic in code
- **Relay stuck**: Test relay manually or replace

### Timer Not Working

- **Time sync**: ESP8266 loses time on power cycle (expected)
- **Set timer**: Make sure you clicked "Set Timer" button
- **Check remaining time**: View in web interface
- **Code logic**: Verify timer countdown in serial monitor

### Overheating

- **Lower temperature**: Reduce target temperature immediately
- **Poor ventilation**: Ensure some airflow in enclosure
- **Heater too powerful**: Use lower wattage heating element
- **Safety first**: Unplug if temperature exceeds 80°C
